# Amazon_sales_analysis
#### Project Overview 
This project focuses on analyzing Amazon sales data to extract valuable business insights. It encompasses data loading, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data transformation, statistical insights, and visualization using Python libraries like pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

#### Key Learnings and Techniques

1. Data Loading and Cleaning Loaded the sales data into a pandas DataFrame from a CSV file. Cleaned the dataset by removing irrelevant columns and handling missing values using dropna(). Ensured the dataset was ready for analysis by performing basic checks on its structure and content.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Gained a quick overview of the dataset using df.shape, df.info(), and df.describe(). Previewed the data using df.head() and df.tail() to understand its structure and key attributes.
3. Data Transformation Converted specific data types, such as transforming postal codes into integers using astype(). Renamed columns to improve readability and usability using the rename() function.
4. Basic Statistical Insights Obtained descriptive statistics for numerical and categorical columns using describe(). Grouped data by key categories, such as summing quantities by size, to derive meaningful insights.
5. Data Visualization Created various visualizations, including histograms, bar plots, pie charts, scatter plots, and count plots to better interpret the data. Customized visualizations by adjusting figure sizes, adding labels, and rotating x-axis labels for improved clarity.
6. Insights Derived Identified that M-size T-shirts were the most popular among customers. Analyzed regional demand, highlighting Maharashtra as a key state for sales. Evaluated B2B sales using a pie chart to understand the business breakdown effectively.
7. Advanced Visualization Techniques Leveraged Seaborn to create advanced visualizations like count plots with hues for deeper analysis. Used Matplotlib for producing histograms, scatter plots, and pie charts with additional features such as bar labels.
8. Working with Categorical Data Converted categorical data types, such as converting Category to string, and visualized their distribution using count plots and pie charts. Project Impact This analysis provided a comprehensive overview of Amazon's sales data, including customer preferences, regional demand, and product popularity. It also highlighted high-demand products and key regions, facilitating better business strategies and data-driven decisions.

Tools and Libraries Used pandas: For data manipulation and analysis. Matplotlib: For creating basic plots and histograms. Seaborn: For more advanced visualizations and aesthetic improvements. This project has significantly strengthened my understanding of data cleaning, transformation, analysis, and visualization, providing valuable experience in using Python for practical business insights.
